# gif-storage
just a github with whatever random gifs I and my friends want to use in discord but cant upload due to 8mb file size limitations.
uses github pages with the domain of https://8bitfenix.github.io/gif-storage/
to use a gif just put its filename after the url, ie for burger time use https://8bitfenix.github.io/gif-storage/burger_time.gif
